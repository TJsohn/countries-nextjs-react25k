# Countries App – Next.js Project

A personalized countries explorer app built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Supabase**, and **Material-UI**.  
This project was developed as part of a course assignment.  
> Initial project structure was provided by the instructor, and I implemented most UI features, search, filtering, routing, authentication flows, and dynamic content.
